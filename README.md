Time on App vs. Time on Website
A company sells clothing online but also offers clothing and style advice in stores. Customers can come into the store, consult with a stylist, and then buy the clothes they want via app or website. The company is in the process of deciding whether to focus on the app or the website (obviously without real credit card numbers and e-mail addresses).
